          <p>A major problem faced by global citizens today is sustainability and improvement of quality of life despite over-population and limited resources. As the world’s population increases and puts increasing demands on the planet’s limited resources due to shifting life-styles, we not only need to monitor how we consume resources but also to optimize resource usage. Some examples of the planet’s limited resources are water, energy, land, food, and air. Today, significant challenges exist for reducing the usage of these resources, while maintaining the quality of life. The growth of the human population has now shifted towards cities and that is why we need them to be smart.</p>

          <p>Although it is very hard to list all that is clear is that the field will be multidisciplinary. There will be data storage and analysis, so Computer Science is necessary. City planning is needed and hence urban planning is necessary. If sensors are needed, related disciplines of engineering (electrical, instrumentation, telecommunication, ...) are necessary. Since there has to be actual construction, civil is necessary.</p>

<br>Then as Step 2, it should set metrics of what it wants to aspire for (the to-be) along with the constraints of the time frame and budget available.
<br>As Step 3, it should pick 1-2 small projects and achieve its defined goals. This may lead to changes to the city's standard operating procedures and IT practices, especially data management, and thus, needs to settle down.
<br>Then as Step 4, it should scale to all the city's procedures. Finally, as step 5, it should review its experience and start from Step 2 again.</p>
